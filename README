This is a program I started writing to learn the curses library in Python 2.7.
Since, it's sorta grown a little bit, I'm really not sure where it's headed.

The file Maze.py is a rewrite of the original program, staticMaze.py, although
it may lack some of the features from the original program at this time.

The file staticMaze.py is old, crappy, and somewhat unstable. It does not run
properly. It's only here for posterity's sake.
